# OSAF

## Installation:
Osaf uses Dune as the build tool. This requires Opam, 
the official package manager for OCaml. Verify your 
Opam installation using the following command:

> opam --version

installation guide here: https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html
I used Opam version 2.0.5 when making this project.

To install Dune, run. I also installed utop which is the 
OCaml REPL tool

> opam install dune
> opam install utop
